# UltraPad
UltraPad does nothing right now but maybe some day it'll do all this stuff!

1. Remap buttons on original N64 controllers
2. Remap control stick values, correcting 3rd party replacement stick gating and sensitivity
3. Connect and play games with bluetooth controllers
4. Play back complex sequences of button presses

## Build Requirements
You'll need to clone the [pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) next to this repo on your disk, as build scripts will be looking for `../pico-sdk` for necessary build files.
